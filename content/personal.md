I am deeply passionate about life and the invigorating world of sports. Each day is a new opportunity to embrace the joys and challenges that come my way. I find solace in the rhythmic pounding of my feet on the pavement, the wind in my face as I cycle through scenic landscapes, and the camaraderie of team sports that teach me the value of unity and perseverance.

Sports are not just a hobby; they are a way of life that keeps me grounded and focused. They remind me of the importance of discipline, the thrill of competition, and the satisfaction of pushing my body to its limits. Whether it's a solitary run at dawn or a spirited game with friends, I cherish every moment that allows me to connect with my physicality and the pulse of life itself.

In every sprint, every lift, every dive, I find a piece of myself that I didn't know existed. The sweat, the laughter, the cheers – these are the elements that make life worth living. I am a firm believer that a healthy body fosters a healthy mind, and thus, I dedicate myself to the pursuit of physical excellence and the celebration of life through sports.

## Dancing 

I'm primarily interested in locking and popping. Below is a quick show on the school playground.

## Badminton 

During my master's studies, badminton was my most frequently played sport. I was fortunate enough to win a prize in the annual school badminton competition.

## Cooking 

On weekends, I enjoy cooking delicious dinners with my colleagues. It's a wonderful time for us to unwind and share amusing stories from the week. I'm particularly well-versed in Dongbei Cai (东北菜), a flavorful cuisine that originates from Northeastern China.

## Others

In my downtime, I make a point of swimming weekly and occasionally engaging in bodybuilding exercises.
